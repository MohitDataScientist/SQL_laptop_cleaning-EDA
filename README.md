# SQL_laptop_cleaning-EDA
Objective:

The objective of this project was to clean and analyze a dataset of laptop prices. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and was originally uncleaned. The cleaning process involved removing duplicate rows, correcting data entry errors, and filling in missing values. New columns were also created to represent additional information about the laptops, such as the screen size, processor type,ram size, rom size and operating system. Finally, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed on the cleaned dataset to identify trends and patterns.

Summary:

The cleaned dataset contained 1,000 rows and 15 columns. The most important columns were the laptop's name, price, screen size, processor type, and operating system. The EDA revealed that the average laptop price was 35000 â‚¹. The most popular screen size was 15 inches, and the most popular processor type was the Intel Core i5. The most popular operating system was Windows 10.

Final Result:

The final result of the project was a cleaned dataset that was ready for further analysis. The EDA revealed some interesting trends and patterns about laptop prices and specifications. This information could be used by businesses to make decisions about product development, marketing, and pricing.
